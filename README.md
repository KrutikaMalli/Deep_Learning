1) A Simple ANN Model using Churn_Modelling dataset
   - AIM: Predicting number of customers that will be exiting the bank.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
   - Feature Scaling
   - GridSearchCV to find best parameters
   - Creating ANN model
   - Summarize the result by their Accuracy score
  
2) CNN Model using Fashion_MNIST
   - AIM: implementation of convolutional neural network to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
   -  The integration of data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and early stopping helps improve model performance and generalization.
   -  By examining the resulting graphs, you can evaluate how well the model is performing during training and validation, helping you make informed decisions about further tuning and adjustments.
